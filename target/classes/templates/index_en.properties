 # Recruitment
recruitmentSection1=In our globalised world the cultural and economical borders are becoming more and more transparent causing the economical migration to increase. Most of these individuals leave their connections, families, culture behind and are motivated only by the promise of financial security. This extrinsic motivation results in a decreased sociability, deprivation and apathy causing the employee to be discomforted and decreasing his/her performance at the workplace. The changes while working abroad, the different cultural climate and language difficulties have a counterproductive effect in the new, challanging environment. Most of the employees find it hard to adapt to this condition. All of these leads to a low self-esteem and increased demotivation which should not be neglected.
