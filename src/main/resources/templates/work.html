                <div class="col-xs-12">In our globalised world the cultural and economical borders are becoming more and more transparent causing the economical migration to increase. Most of these individuals leave their connections, families, culture behind and are motivated only by the promise of financial security. This extrinsic motivation results in a decreased sociability, deprivation and apathy causing the employee to be discomforted and decreasing his/her performance at the workplace.

                    The changes while working abroad, the different cultural climate and language difficulties have a counterproductive effect in the new, challanging environment. Most of the employees find it hard to adapt to this condition. All of these leads to a low self-esteem and increased demotivation which should not be neglected.

                    In our Just in Time service we offer the continuous assistance and follow-up with the employees giving them a hand to overcome the upcoming obstacles and facilitating their integration at the new environment. Due to our continous support we are able to intervene immediately if needed.
                    We also aid the development of organisational identity of each future and existing employee in order to have a long-term and smooth employment.Thanks to all these measures we ensure that you get an employee who is able to successfully adapt to any situation and fits the requirements the best.
                    Human Skill team provides constant support and believes in preventive approach so no corrective intervention is needed allowing us to decrease your overall cost of recruitment.

                    Bearing in mind both the clients and the candidates needs we provide quality service in the dynamically changing market.
